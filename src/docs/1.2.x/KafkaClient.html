<p>Lagom provides an implementation of the Message Broker API that uses Kafka. In the remainder you will learn how to add the dependency in your build, and how to configure and tune topic&rsquo;s publishers and subscribers.</p><h2 id="Dependency"><a class="section-marker" href="#Dependency">§</a><a href="#dependency" name="dependency">Dependency</a></h2>
<p>To use this feature add the following in your project&rsquo;s build.</p>
<p>In Maven:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.lightbend.lagom&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;lagom-javadsl-kafka-broker_2.11&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;${lagom.version}&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In sbt:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-sbt">libraryDependencies += lagomJavadslKafkaBroker</code></pre><h2 id="Configuration"><a class="section-marker" href="#Configuration">§</a><a href="#configuration" name="configuration">Configuration</a></h2>
<p>The Lagom Kafka Client implementation is built using <a href="https://github.com/akka/reactive-kafka">akka-stream-kafka</a>. The akka-stream-kafka library wraps the official <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html">Apache Java Kafka client</a> and exposes a (Akka) stream based API to publish/consume messages to/from Kafka. Therefore, we have effectively three libraries at play, with each of them exposing its own configuration. Let&rsquo;s explore the configuration keys exposed by each layer, starting with the one sitting at the top, i.e., the Lagom Kafka Client.</p><h3 id="Lagom-Kafka-Client1"><a class="section-marker" href="#Lagom-Kafka-Client1">§</a><a href="#lagom-kafka-client" name="lagom-kafka-client">Lagom Kafka Client</a></h3>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-conf">lagom.broker.kafka {
  # The URLs of the Kafka brokers. Separate each URL with a comma.
  brokers = ${lagom.broker.defaults.kafka.brokers}

  client {
    default {
      # Exponential backoff for failures
      failure-exponential-backoff {
        # minimum (initial) duration until processor is started again
        # after failure
        min = 3s

        # the exponential back-off is capped to this duration
        max = 30s

        # additional random delay is based on this factor
        random-factor = 0.2
      }
    }

    # configuration used by the Lagom Kafka producer
    producer = ${lagom.broker.kafka.client.default}
    producer.role = &quot;&quot;

    # configuration used by the Lagom Kafka consumer
    consumer {
      failure-exponential-backoff = ${lagom.broker.kafka.client.default.failure-exponential-backoff}

      # Number of messages batched together by the consumer before the related messages&#39;
      # offsets are committed to Kafka.
      # By increasing the batching-size you are trading speed with the risk of having
      # to re-process a larger number of messages if a failure occurs.
      # The value provided must be strictly greater than zero.
      batching-size = 20

      # Interval of time waited by the consumer before the currently batched messages&#39;
      # offsets are committed to Kafka.
      # This parameter is useful to ensure that messages&#39; offsets are always committed
      # within a fixed amount of time.
      # The value provided must be strictly greater than zero.

<p>First, notice you can pass the location of your Kafka brokers via the key <code>lagom.broker.kafka.brokers</code>. In production, you will usually want to have at least two brokers for resiliency. Make sure to separate each broker URL with a comma.</p>
<p>Second, we have configuration that is specific to the publisher and the subscriber. The <code>lagom.broker.kafka.client.default.failure-exponential-backoff</code> defines configuration for what to do when a publisher or subscriber stream fails. Specifically, it allows you to configure the backoff time that is awaited before restarting a publishing/consuming stream. Failure can happen for different reasons, for instance it may be due to an application error, or because of a network error. Independently of the cause, Lagom will keep retrying to restart the stream (whilst waiting longer and longer between each failed retry). As you can see, both the publisher and subscriber use the same defaults, but different values for either of them can be set.</p>
<p>Third, the consumer has a few more configuration keys allowing you to decide how often the read-side offset is persisted in the datastore. When tuning these values, you are trading performances (storing the offset every time a message is consumed can be costly), with the risk of having to re-process some message if a failure occurs.</p><h3 id="Akka-Stream-Kafka-configuration"><a class="section-marker" href="#Akka-Stream-Kafka-configuration">§</a><a href="#akka-stream-kafka-configuration" name="akka-stream-kafka-configuration">Akka Stream Kafka configuration</a></h3>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/akka/reactive-kafka/blob/master/core/src/main/resources/reference.conf">akka-stream-kafka reference.conf</a> to find out about the available configuration parameters.</p><h3 id="Apache-Java-Kafka-Client"><a class="section-marker" href="#Apache-Java-Kafka-Client">§</a><a href="#apache-java-kafka-client" name="apache-java-kafka-client">Apache Java Kafka Client</a></h3>
<p>See the <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#producerconfigs">Producer Configs</a> documentation to learn about the exposed configuration for the publisher. While, for the subscriber, see the <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#newconsumerconfigs">New Consumer Configs</a>. The only caveat is that if you need to change the value of any of the configuration provided by the Java Kafka Client, you must prepend the desired configuration key you want to change with <code>akka.kafka.consumer.kafka-clients</code>, for the consumer, or <code>akka.kafka.producer.kafka-clients</code>. For instance, let&rsquo;s assume you&rsquo;d like to change the consumer&rsquo;s <code>request.timeout.ms</code>, you should add the following in the service&rsquo;s application.conf:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-conf">akka.kafka.producer.kafka-clients {
  request.timeout.ms = 30000
}
