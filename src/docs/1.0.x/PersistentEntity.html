<h1 id="Persistent-Entity"><a class="section-marker" href="#Persistent-Entity">§</a>Persistent Entity</h1><p><a href="ES_CQRS.html">Event Sourcing and CQRS</a> is a recommended introduction to this section.</p><p>A <code>PersistentEntity</code> has a stable entity identifier, with which it can be accessed from the service implementation or other places. The state of an entity is persistent (durable) using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj591559.aspx">Event Sourcing</a>. We represent all state changes as events and those immutable facts are appended to an event log. To recreate the current state of an entity when it is started we replay these events.</p><p>A persistent entity corresponds to an <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DDD_Aggregate.html">Aggregate Root</a> in Domain-Driven Design terms. Each instance has a stable identifier and for a given id there will only be one instance of the entity. Lagom takes care of distributing those instances across the cluster of the service. If you know the identifier you can send messages, so called commands, to the entity.</p><p>The persistent entity is also a transaction boundary. Invariants can be maintained within one entity but not across several entities.</p><p>If you are familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API">JPA</a> it is worth noting that a <code>PersistentEntity</code> can be used for similar things as a JPA <code>@Entity</code> but several aspects are rather different. For example, a JPA <code>@Entity</code> is loaded from the database from wherever it is needed, i.e. there may be many Java object instances with the same entity identifier. In contrast, there is only one instance of <code>PersistentEntity</code> with a given identifier. With JPA you typically only store current state and the history of how the state was reached is not captured.</p><p>You interact with a <code>PersistentEntity</code> by sending command messages to it. Commands are processed sequentially, one at a time, for a specific entity instance. A command may result in state changes that are persisted as events, representing the effect of the command. The current state is not stored for every change, since it can be derived from the events. These events are only ever appended to storage, nothing is ever mutated, which allows for very high transaction rates and efficient replication.</p><p>The entities are automatically distributed across the nodes in the cluster of the service. Each entity runs only at one place, and messages can be sent to the entity without requiring the sender to know the location of the entity. If a node is stopped the entities running on that node will be started on another node when a message is sent to it next time. When new nodes are added to the cluster some existing entities are rebalanced to the new nodes to spread the load.</p><p>An entity is kept alive, holding its current state in memory, as long as it is used. When it has not been used for a while it will automatically be passivated to free up resources.</p><p>When an entity is started it replays the stored events to restore the current state. This can be either the full history of changes or starting from a snapshot which will reduce recovery times.</p><h2 id="Dependency"><a class="section-marker" href="#Dependency">§</a>Dependency</h2><p>To use this feature add the following in your project&rsquo;s build:</p>

Cassandra is a very scalable distributed database, and it is also flexible enough to support typical use cases of reactive services.</p><h3 id="What-if-I-dont-want-to-use-Cassandra?"><a class="section-marker" href="#What-if-I-dont-want-to-use-Cassandra?">§</a>What if I don&rsquo;t want to use Cassandra?</h3><p>The Persistence module in Lagom only supports Cassandra as backend data store. It is especially the read-side that is tightly integrated with Cassandra instead of providing an abstraction on top of it.
