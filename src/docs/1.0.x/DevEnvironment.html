<h1 id="Development-Environment"><a class="section-marker" href="#Development-Environment">§</a>Development Environment</h1><p>Lagom&rsquo;s sbt-based development console allows running any number of services together with a single command.</p><p>The same command also reloads your services when the code changes, so that you don&rsquo;t have to manually restart them. You can stay focused on your work and let Lagom do the compiling and reloading.</p><h2 id="Starting-the-development-console"><a class="section-marker" href="#Starting-the-development-console">§</a>Starting the development console</h2><p>Assuming you have followed the <a href="Installation.html">Installation</a> instructions, it&rsquo;s now time to fire up the console on your Lagom project directory:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">$ cd &lt;path to your Lagom project&gt;
$ activator
[info] ...
&gt;
</code></pre><h2 id="Running-all-services"><a class="section-marker" href="#Running-all-services">§</a>Running all services</h2><p>To run all Lagom services together, with automatic reloading, just enter <code>runAll</code> in the activator console:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">&gt; runAll
[info] ...
[info] Service helloworld-impl listening for HTTP on 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:23966
[info] Service hellostream-impl listening for HTTP on 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:27462
(Services started, use Ctrl+D to stop and go back to the console...)
</code></pre><p>This may take a while if you have a lot of services or if dependencies are being retrieved for the first time.</p><p>Once the &ldquo;Services started&rdquo; message has appeared, if you make a change to your source code, you&rsquo;ll see output like this in the console:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">[info] Compiling 1 Java source to /&lt;project-path&gt;/target/scala-2.11/classes...

--- (RELOAD) ---
</code></pre><h2 id="Behind-the-scenes"><a class="section-marker" href="#Behind-the-scenes">§</a>Behind the scenes</h2><p>What&rsquo;s happening behind the scenes when you <code>runAll</code>?</p>
<ul>
  <li>an embedded Service Locator is started</li>
  <li>a Cassandra server is started</li>
  <li>your services start
  <ul>
    <li>&hellip;and register with the Service Locator</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul><p>This all happens automatically without special code or additional configuration.</p><p>You can verify that your services are running by viewing <code>http://localhost:8000/services</code> in a web browser (or with a command line tool such as <code>curl</code>). The Service Locator, running on port 8000, will return JSON such as:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;hellostream&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://0.0.0.0:26230&quot;},
 {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;cas_native&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;tcp://127.0.0.1:4000/cas_native&quot;},
 {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;helloservice&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://0.0.0.0:24266&quot;}]
</code></pre><p><code>cas_native</code> is the <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a> server. As you will learn in the <a href="PersistentEntity.html">documentation for writing persistent and clustered services</a>, Cassandra is the default database in Lagom, and it&rsquo;s an integral part of the development environment.</p><p>Both the Service Locator and Cassandra are covered in more detail in the sections that follow.</p>
