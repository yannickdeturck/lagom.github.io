<h1 id="Lagom-core-concepts"><a class="section-marker" href="#Lagom-core-concepts">§</a>Lagom core concepts</h1><p>Lagom provides tools and APIs that guide developers to build a system out of microservices. The key to success is good architecture, rooted in a solid understanding of microservices concepts and best practices.</p><p>The philosophy behind Lagom is presented in <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/reactive-microservices-architecture.html">Reactive Microservices Architecture: Design Principles for Distributed Systems</a>, a report by Jonas Bonér, available free. We strongly recommend reading it before learning Lagom. Much of the following documentation builds upon and refers back to this report.</p>
