<h1 id="Splitting-a-system-into-multiple-builds"><a class="section-marker" href="#Splitting-a-system-into-multiple-builds">§</a>Splitting a system into multiple builds</h1><p>For a small system maintained by a single team, it&rsquo;s fine to have all your services in one build. Doing it that way makes it really easy to run all your services with the <code>runAll</code> task, as we&rsquo;ll see later in the <a href="RunningServices.html">Running Services</a> section of this manual.</p><p>If you have multiple teams, though, then as described already in <a href="BuildConcepts.html">Lagom build concepts</a>, we recommend splitting your system into multiple builds.</p><p>If you aren&rsquo;t concerned with scaling to multiple teams yet, feel free to skip this section for now.</p><h2 id="Publishing-services"><a class="section-marker" href="#Publishing-services">§</a>Publishing services</h2><p>Even with multiple builds, you will still often want to run your services together in development. Lagom allows importing services published from one build into another build.</p><p>Suppose you have a <code>helloworld</code> service that you want to publish and import into another build:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-sbt">organization in ThisBuild := &quot;sample.helloworld&quot;

scalaVersion in ThisBuild := &quot;2.11.7&quot;

lazy val helloworldApi = (project in file(&quot;helloworld-api&quot;))
  .settings(version := &quot;1.0&quot;)
  .settings(libraryDependencies += lagomJavadslApi)

lazy val helloworldImpl = (project in file(&quot;helloworld-impl&quot;))
  .enablePlugins(LagomJava)
  .settings(
    version := &quot;1.0&quot;,
    libraryDependencies += lagomJavadslPersistence
  )
  .dependsOn(helloworldApi)</code></pre><p>You can publish this to your local sbt repository by running <code>publishLocal</code>. This is the simplest way to publish a service, however, it means every developer that wants to run a build that imports the service will need to run <code>publishLocal</code> themselves on the service, and they&rsquo;ll need to do that for each version that they want to import.</p><p>More commonly, many developers can share a single Maven or Ivy repository that they can publish and pull artifacts from. There are a few options for how to do this, if you&rsquo;re happy to use a hosted repository, <a href="https://bintray.com">Bintray</a> is a good option, if you want to run the repository locally, <a href="https://www.jfrog.com/open-source/">Artifactory</a> or <a href="http://www.sonatype.com/nexus/solution-overview">Nexus</a> are common solutions. For information on how to configure these with sbt, see <a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Publishing.html">how to publish artifacts</a>.</p><h3 id="Publishing-to-Bintray"><a class="section-marker" href="#Publishing-to-Bintray">§</a>Publishing to Bintray</h3><p>Bintray offers both free open source hosting, as well as a paid private hosting service.</p><p>If you are using Bintray, the first thing you&rsquo;ll need to do is sign up for an account, and create an organization. In your Bintray organization, you can then create a Bintray repository, we recommend creating a Maven repository.</p><p>Having set Bintray up, you now need to configure your sbt build to publish to this. First, add the sbt-bintray plugin to your <code>project/plugins.sbt</code> file:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-sbt">addSbtPlugin(&quot;me.lessis&quot; % &quot;bintray-sbt&quot; % &quot;0.3.0&quot;)</code></pre><p>The Bintray plugin manages its own credentials, this can be configured by running <code>activator bintrayChangeCredentials</code>, which will save the credentials in <code>~/.bintray/.credentials</code>.</p><p>Once you&rsquo;ve authenticated with Bintray, you can then configure your build to publish to it, by adding the following configuration to <code>build.sbt</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-sbt">// Set this to the organization that you want to publish to
bintrayOrganization in ThisBuild := Some(&quot;example-organization&quot;)
// This is needed for projects that are not open source
bintrayOmitLicense in ThisBuild := false</code></pre><h2 id="Importing-a-service"><a class="section-marker" href="#Importing-a-service">§</a>Importing a service</h2><p>The <code>helloworld</code> Lagom service can be imported by adding the following declaration to your build:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-sbt">lazy val helloworld = lagomExternalProject(&quot;helloworld&quot;, &quot;sample.helloworld&quot; %% &quot;helloworld-impl&quot; % &quot;1.0&quot;)</code></pre><p>The first argument passed to <code>lagomExternalProject</code> is the name that will be used in your build to refer to this externally defined project. While, the second argument provides the dependency to the <code>helloworld-impl</code> JAR, using the conventional sbt syntax for declaring dependencies. Note in fact that the <code>lagomExternalProject</code> method returns a sbt <code>Project</code>, which you can further customize if needed.</p><p>After having added the external Lagom project to your build, just type <code>reload</code> in the sbt console. Then, when executing <code>runAll</code>, you should see that the <code>helloworld</code> service is started, together with all other services defined in the build:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">&gt; runAll
[info] ...
[info] Service helloworld listening for HTTP on 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:22407
[info] ...
(Services started, use Ctrl+D to stop and go back to the console...)
</code></pre><p>Now that you have integrated the <code>helloworld</code> service in your build, any of your Lagom projects can communicate with it after adding a library dependency to its <code>helloworld-api</code> artefact:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-sbt">lazy val greetingsApi = (project in file(&quot;greetings-api&quot;))
  .settings(libraryDependencies += lagomJavadslApi)

lazy val greetingsImpl = (project in file(&quot;greetings-impl&quot;)).enablePlugins(LagomJava)
  .settings(libraryDependencies += &quot;sample.helloworld&quot; %% &quot;helloworld-api&quot; % &quot;1.0&quot;)
  .dependsOn(greetingsApi)</code></pre>
